All features must be written and working before access restrictions can be placed. The rudiments of the CMS permission system is already in place. Once all website features are ready, go back and place the access restrictions (permission checks or \"flags\") to allow or block users as the permissions dictate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Permission System Improvement</strong></p>\r\n<p>Consider altering the CMS permission system to make it more scalable and flexible for users who have multiple roles on the website. Make the usergroup field in the maj_user table a CSV list of all usergroups in which each account belongs. When permissions are cached on every page hit, the permissions for all of the account\'s usergroups is queried from the <strong>maj_permits</strong> table. All permission levels for each individual feature (i.e. henceforth called a \"rule\") is compared in a loop and the permissions array (which actually determines what can and cannot be done by this account) will save the permission level is the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">highest available</span></strong> level for that rule. For example, if an account is a normal user with a permission level of 3 in photos but also a moderator with a permission level of 7 in photos, both groups\' permissions are queried and the highest level available between those groups is actually stored in the permits array (in this case, 7).</p>\r\n<p>When querying across the usergroup field, use the MySQL <strong>IN()</strong> and <strong>FIND_IN_SET()</strong> functions to locate a value in the CSV list. The add/manage user form should use the dynamic_checklist() function to present all usergroups and allow multiple selections.</p>\r\n<p>Usergroups also need priority. If a user is a member of the banned usergroup, their permissions will be zero, but should outweigh all other groups. Consider assigning each usergroup an integer weight.

It is difficult to package updates and updating the CMS is unusually spotty.</p>\r\n<p>The following issues should be addressed in this job:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>The difficulty in packaging new updates</strong><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Adding a new update to the CMS is highly complicated. We must account for every file changed and include them in the TAR archive of every packaged update. An SQL file must be included to make database changes. Any TPLs that need to be distributed throughout the templates must be included in a tpls.tar file in the root directory of the TAR. A text file of files to update must be included as well. This whole process is far too difficult a procedure and doesn\'t take advantage of cross-server communication technologies available to us.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Silent MySQL errors during update process</strong><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\">When an SQL error occurs during the database update process, you never know until you come back to the updates page and notice your version number has not changed (assuming you notice at all). By then, all of the files have been overwritten, potentially breaking the website. This is an issue I have been unable to address because of the way database changes are executed with the current update system: by importing the SQL file from the TAR archive. If errors happen, SQL simply stops without informing the user or providing any resolution. This is not acceptable.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>The need for complete CMS version archiving for purposes of testing the updates</strong><br /><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Everytime an update happens, we tend to use one of our unlaunched sites in development as a guinea pig to test the update. We can do better than that. I purpose we begin archiving the entire CMS everytime an update happens so that I can make copies of the previous versions as needed to perform standard update tests. This gives us an additional benefit that will help the update system: Majicko 3.0.0 can request any file in the CMS to be sent down and replace what is there. This is useful in cases where someone has accidentally deleted or damaged their website files.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The new updater is capable of receiving requests from any copy of Majicko 3.x and returning any file requested throughout the CMS (except within the /templates directory). <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">See <strong>Template Updates</strong> below.</span> That means each archive of each Majicko 3.x version will include the entire CMS on the updates server.</p>\r\n<p>The general functionality of the new purposed CMS update system:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Execute a cURL request to the update server (include version number): <strong>http://updates.instysite.com/3.x</strong></li>\r\n<li>If an update is available, return the appropriate description of the update and user controls to initiate the update.</li>\r\n<li>Execute a cURL request to the update server to return an XML list of files to be updated (save to the updates directory). This will show a similar dialogue to what we see right now. This view should invite the user to download their customized files. It may be worth exploring solutions for grepping the files and showing the user where they differ.</li>\r\n<li>Backup all files to be overwritten in the /admin/updates/[update id] directory.</li>\r\n<li>Execute cURL requests to the update server to download all of the updated files.</li>\r\n<li>Execute a cURL request to return an XML list of all database changes. Loop through the queries and execute them.</li>\r\n<li>Show the user a list of templates that require updating (see below).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Template Updates</strong></p>\r\n<p>The following issues need to be addressed:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Template variation<br />The assumption is that templates may be wildly different than they were when installed, but new updates to the CMS may require updates to the template. The templates must be able to detect when they individual</li>\r\n<li>Unnecessary downloading<br />If a given copy of Majicko doesn\'t have one of the stock templates in the current system, it will still receive updates for it. This is unnecessary and creates unneeded files.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Templates have always been an ire for the update system because the templates are where all of the website variation is located. The PHP pages on all copies of Majicko should theoretically be considered uniform and, therefore, the user is responsible for any customizations to them. However, the templates should not be considered uniform and must, therefore, have a separate solution than the update system described above. An additional concern is allowing other parties to produce templates and allow them to keep them up to date.</p>\r\n<p>The template updates should go as follows:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Template records should include the following additional fields<ol type=\"a\">\r\n<li><strong>Template Version</strong>: The version number for which the template is intended.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hostname</strong>: A server to which update requests can be made </li>\r\n<li><strong>Port</strong>: A port to which the host server can be reached</li>\r\n<li><strong>Template Identifier</strong>: A unique indentifier number that distinguishes the template on its update server</li>\r\n<li><strong>Template Install Date</strong>: A timestamp of the date in which the template was installed (used for comparing against file mod dates)</li>\r\n</ol></li>\r\n<li>The update system will connect to the hostname to which the template belongs and return an XML list of files changed (same as above).</li>\r\n<li>Templates should only ever require one query to update it, so this can be included in the XML returned above.</li>\r\n<li>Display the list of files to be overwritten, pointing out which ones have been customized</li>\r\n<li>Backup all files to be overwritten</li>\r\n<li>Execute a cURL request to download all of the files</li>\r\n<li>Execute any update queries found in the XML file</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The templates may now be updated separately at the leisure of the administrator of each website and customizations noted. Only the templates they actually have will be available to update. That way, we\'re not having the CMS download TPL files for updated stock templates that the website no longer has. This system may also provide a means of distributing templates so that stock Majicko need not have every template in existence.</p>\r\n<p>We will need to have a copy of the template hosting scripts available for anyone who wants to distribute templates and keep the updates available.</p>','',8,'http://dev3.majicko.com',0,0.00,0,0,0),(1071,19,2,0,1336021200,0,7,'Consolidate menu tables and footer','<p>There is little need to have 2 menu tables and the footer menu being in neither of them.

They were all in the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory on websites throughout our server. The PHP code within these files reveal highly malicious intent including attempts to create a PHP script that allows unsecure uploading of additional files to the server and executing PHP code posted through an external HTTP request.</p>\r\n<p>While copying Hancock Recreation for the creation of a development site on <strong>vps.bandwise.com</strong>, I found several similar files in their <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory and some PHP files containing scripts capable of infecting a client with a virus. Hancock\'s website has had a major security breach worse than others we have seen with these GIF images in them. After examining the code within each file, I have traced the path detailing which files led to the creation of which others. All lead back to the suspicious GIF images. Hancock is a Majicko 1.5.0 website, so this is apparently a vulernability that has been around for a long time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Somehow, these GIF images containing hidden PHP code are getting into all Majicko websites and the PHP code within them is getting executed, leading to further vulnerabilities.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I first attempted to find a component in Majicko that allows unvalidated file uploading. An observation that gave me a clue. All of the offending GIF images that conceal PHP code had to be GIF images, rather than actual PHP pages, because the component that was placing them on the server must validate against any file that isn\'t an image. This also explains why the chosen directory was the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory. The vulnerable components must be one designed to upload image files to the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory and has no security checks against unauthorized use!</p>\r\n<p>The only front office scripts that allow for image uploading are related to the photo gallery and user avatars. You must be logged in to see these components and there are many permission checks in the way. The back office has lots of file uploading in many places, but they all take place in the validations file, having lots of security checks in the way. The culprit must be a script that isn\'t a part of the Majicko platform and has been around almost since the beginning. I immediately thought of the WYSIWYG editors. They all have PHP-based image uploading scripts that validate against files that are not images. Their uploaders all default to the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory. They are not part of Majicko and, thus, do not check user permissions. They are in public directories accessible to anyone. Hancock has only one WYSIWYG and it has been a part of Majicko almost since the beginning, openWYSIWYG. The PHP component that openWYSIWYG uses to upload images is located in <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/clients/wysiwyg/addons/imagelibrary/insert_image.php</span>.</p>\r\n<p>I tried creating a test GIF image, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">test.php.gif</span>, with some PHP code inside it that creates a text file in the same directory. I also created a simple HTML page, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">exploit.html</span>, with a form that uploads the graphic to <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">http://dev23.majicko.com/clients/wysiwyg/addons/imagelibrary/insert_image.php</span>. I opened this page in my browser from my desktop, selected my test GIF, and submitted the form. I wound up staring at the PHP output from <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">insert_image.php</span> on <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">dev23.majicko.com</span>. I checked the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory in my FTP client and <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">test.php.gif</span> was now on the server! I found the vulnerability. Now I need to know how the PHP code gets executed.</p>\r\n<p>I tried browsing up the GIF in my browser. I saw some output from the PHP code, but it didn\'t appear to execute. I tried locating a means of executing the GIF through a PHP include, but found nothing. I pointed my HTML form to Hancock\'s web space instead. My test GIF appeared in the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory after submitting it. I browsed up the file in my browser. This time, the PHP code executed and <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">exploit.txt</span> now appeared in the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">/images</span> directory on Hancock!</p>\r\n<p>Apparently, Hancock\'s server at Access Northeast is vulnerable to PHP attacks via GIF images. Our server allows the GIFs to get into place via the openWYSIWYG vulernability, but will not execute the PHP code. This explains why Hancock had more copies of the GIFs and much more malicious PHP scripts in place.</p>\r\n<p>The openWYSIWYG editor is out of date and new versions are no longer being produced. Most user use tinyMCE on new Majicko websites. My recommendation is to upgrade all Majicko customers to tinyMCE and remove openWYSIWYG in further releases of the CMS.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Note:</strong></p>\r\n<p>After contacting Access Northeast about this vulernability, they made some useful suggestions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Thanks for your email, we truly appreciate any and all feedback that helps us to secure our systems better. Regarding the issue you\'ve brought to our attention, image files are being uploaded to your application with valid image mime headers but with PHP code embedded within them which the web server is executing because the upload files have multiple file extensions (ie, file.php.gif). <br /><br />Apache\'s mod_mime module controls the execution order of files with multiple extensions (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mod_mime.html) and I have overridden the default setting to only allow the server to observe the last extension when it comes to interpreting php files. Now direct calls to these files will not be execute them as PHP code.<br /><br />That being said, if files with PHP code embedded within them are allowed to be uploaded to the site, they could still potentially be included or invoked from your other PHP files. You should ensure that your file uploads are being sanitized and validated to prevent those sorts of abuse. Some good sources for information on PHP upload best practices can be found at the following links:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/67-PHP-security-exploit-with-GIF-images.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/67-PHP-security-exploit-with-GIF-images.html</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.scanit.be/uploads/php-file-upload.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.scanit.be/uploads/php-file-upload.pdf</a><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Joe Conlin</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We should take into account what happens when files have multiple extensions.

I have logged into WHMCS Admin and created an admin group called \"API Group\" that has only the API Access permission. In this group is one admin account, apicall. This will be used for executing API requests between Majicko and WHMCS.

I am uncertain if this will dissallow me from performing direct select inserts between the DBs. However, this may undesirable anyway since a degree of data validation and massaging will be necessary.</span></li>\r\n<li>The Ora dump DB is positively filled with data in all caps. PHP has functions for fixing this, so data should be fixed as it is inserted into the destination DB.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I located a small bug in my import scripts, so I had to erase my temporary tables and run all of my scripts again. This provided me with an opportunity to test things in flow. I have a concern about data integrity that I would like to document.</p>\r\n<p>The leases table, TBL_GENUS_LEASE_CPT, in the Oracle dump is nearly useless in addition to being a confusing mess. It contains 4 columns: LEASE_NO, TREE_FARM, ACRES, and OPAREA. Morgan was very specific to tell me that the ACRES column shouldn\'t be used because it wouldn\'t reflect what was billed to the customer, which is what the hcm_leases table needs. The OPAREA column, which I assume is a region ID is empty in many records and unneeded in the HCM lease records. The data I see in the TREE_FARM column appears to correspond to land owners (not tree farms) in the TBL_LLS_OPAREAS table rather than the OPAREA column serving this purpose. Unfortunately, only some of the records match land owners currently in the database, so this appears to be out of date.</p>\r\n<p>In order to build a coherent lease record, I must query the TBL_GENUS_LEASE_CPT table, joining with the TBL_LLS_MSTR (contracts) table, to get my lease numbers, lease types, and acres. I can also filter by the LSEEXPIRESCCYYMMDD column to get only leases and contracts from 2007 and forward, so this appears beneficial. In order to get the rest of the data needed to complete the lease record, I must rely on the contents of the compstand XML file, which contains the land owner and tree farm where the LEASE_NO columns match. This will complete the lease records, but there is a caveat. There are 157 leases in the TBL_GENUS_LEASE_CPT table (past 2007) which do not appear in the compstand XML file and, therefore, cannot be inserted. These are incomplete records that must be repaired before I can do anything with them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Compartment Numbers - Leading Zeros</strong></p>\r\n<p>In Campbell\'s <strong>Land Lease System User Guide</strong> (page  36), compartment numbers are said to be 5 digits and may lead with a  zero. The LLS shaves leading zeros off. If compartment numbers are never  fewer than 5 digits, I can have the CMS keep the leading zeros to make  the compartment numbers accurately readable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Warnings</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There are some tables in the Ora dump DB which may be too big to import from phpMyAdmin even by themselves: <strong>customer history</strong>, <strong>historic invoices</strong>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;\"><strong>history log</strong></span>. <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">We cannot use phpMyAdmin to import the oracle dump.</span></em></strong> I created a directory called \"/dump\" which includes a small script for importing the .sql files.

This feature is currently outdatedas it was written before the charges table was installed, but it will work like the invoice form in Manage Available leases (I think that is Step 5). You simply add a new invoice to the contract in question and attach whatever charges you need to it. If we need to credit a customer, I may recommend doing a credit memo based on this feature rather than altering an existing invoice.</span></li>\r\n</ol></li>\r\n<li>Mke for web/email/print<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">This quesion is unclear, but new invoices added to the system will automatically e-mail the club contact and alert them that a new invoice is waiting.

In which case, an e-mail receipt would be sent to the user by the paymen gateway.

Therefore, whatever information is provided here becomes the reply to information for the club contact. They simply reply to the e-mail. Also, most e-mail features on the website appends a Campbell Group footer at the bottom on the e-mail that contains the company contact information.</span></li>\r\n</ol></li>\r\n<li>Emails with attachments - one/many<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">I am unable to comment on this directly since I am still writing this feature, but there will be e-mail attachments.

They are largely automated, but some are manual. For example, if a club contact submits a payment on the website, their history will reflect this without anyone manually adding the record. Conversely, if an admin user logs in and has a telephone conversation with the club contact, they may document this exchange manually from the Comments tabs. The history tab will reflect this. It is to be noted that the Comments tab has not yet been interfaces with the History tab, but it will do so before launch. I also want it carefully noted that I have only been tenuously informed about what event history records are to be added and on which events. Some events that you may expect to generate an event record may fail to do so. As such, a manual form for doing this may be desirable and I must be informed when one can be auto-generated. These are usually easy to put in.

If a user is in another timezone, they see timestamps throughout all of our websites displayed in server time and cannot change this. There is a setting in the maj_settings table for changing the website\'s local timezone, but this is largely not used.</p>\r\n<p>We are beginning to see customers in other states and other countries. Some of these customers will be coordinating business, the movement of money, and performing customer interactions. Being unable to coordinate times will cause severe issues, especially on websites where the calendar is being used. In addition, we are constantly being tasked to import existing data into custom programming projects for our customers. Such imports always include date/time data which must be converted to a Unix timestamp. We make the assumption that these timestamps are in our timezone, which is a dangerous assumption.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Date/Time Environment</strong></p>\r\n<p>The new date/time model will be based on UTC and utilize the PHP <a href=\"http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.datetime.php\" target=\"_blank\">DateTime</a> library extensively. I have already verified that our VPS server has this library. Majicko will declare 4 constants very high in the global file:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>UTCTIME - The current UTC timestamp. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">All database inserts will store this value as the current time.</span></strong> PHP has a variety of ways to get this value when needed. We will abandon the use of the PHP time() function.</li>\r\n<li>SYSTIME - The current timestamp on the server. This will be displayed where needed for troubleshooting purposes.</li>\r\n<li>MAJTIME - The current display time offset to the timezone set in the maj_settings table. This will serve as the default display time on the website.</li>\r\n<li>USERTIME - This is the current time offset to the timezone in a given user account record. This will overwrite MAJTIME as the current time for users who are logged in.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Displaying a Date/Time Record</strong></p>\r\n<p>When a record is queried from the database, it will be in UTC time. If the user has an account, the record\'s timestamp will be converted to their timezone for display. Otherwise, it will be converted to the timezone define in maj_settings. It will then be displayed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>User-Entered Date/Time</strong></p>\r\n<p>Occasionally, a form will ask the user to select a date and/or time to associate with a record. For example, a user may select a date and time to hold an event on the calendar. When a user submits a form containing a date, it should be <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5746531/php-utc-date-time-string-to-timezone\" target=\"_blank\">converted to UTC</a> based on either the user\'s timezone or the maj_settings timezone.</p>','',8,'http://dev3.majick.com',0,0.00,0,0,0),(1234,2,2,0,0,0,10,'Speed and performance adjustments','<p>I am going to try and patch Campbell with my new date/time model so that dates and timestamps reflect the timezones users are in.

He explained that his concern is that someone may use the website to locate a piece of land, travel to the location, get injured, and pursue legal actions. The hold harmless agreement will attempt to narrow the opportunities for a person to do so, assuming the information given with the agreement was not falsified. I do not recommend this model. I recommend forcing the user agreement upon registration of the user\'s account which is standard for all websites, ensures that we can identify the person, alleviates the problem of a user supplying false information with their agreement.

Can this be corrected to show the newest first and oldest last?</li>\r\n<li>When I click on a specific statement it appears to need some formatting related to the club name. What is CSZ? The Total is correct, but the detail doesn&rsquo;t accurately calculate campsite income. For this example it should include $3,500 of campsite/structure fees. Also if 10% is shown in back for penalty amount it adds that to Amount Due even if the Due date is months away. This is a late fee and should be shown as one.</li>\r\n<li>Available Leases Bids &ndash; I have selected Denied bids but the instructions say that pending bids are displayed first.&nbsp; I think as a new user this could be confusing, I think we should remove this wording or have it change to explain what is selected.</li>\r\n<li>Under HLA Blue add Amendment is still not working same error message as before &ldquo;serial number the same&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>Under Manage Available Lease Bids I have placed two Lease it now bids and have not received an e-mail for either one of them?</li>\r\n<li>Under Manage Block when you open a Block it still shows lots of counties in this view.</li>\r\n<li>When converting a bid to an HLA I think we need to work on the Bid form the bidder is feeling out and the information that pulls into the system.&nbsp; Most of the information they fill out is lost and some is not in the same format. I can see this being much more user friendly.</li>\r\n<li>When you place a bid it has the following &ldquo;You are about to close bidding on this license, Submitting &ldquo;License in Now&rdquo; price will require that you submit payment within 10 days for the full amount shown below.&rdquo; The only below amount is the acre rate? It has beside the acre rate your bid amount in total (USD). I think we should still show the rate they are accepting but also the total amount due</li>\r\n<li>Once I approved a bid and used convert to HLA the bid is no longer in the system?&nbsp; Where did it go?</li>\r\n<li>I was trying to re-test convert to HLA and I got this?</li>\r\n<li>When a club makes a bid and has to give an e-mail it does not keep that e-mail and bring to over to the back office.&nbsp; Also when you convert to an HLA it does not change the block status to contracted it still shows as available.</li>\r\n<li>When you convert a block to an available lease and hit summit and error message opens that says&rdquo; The selected lease was not found&rdquo;? Can it not just open the available lease back up?</li>\r\n<li>When you add a payment and you have keyed the wrong amount it gives you a chance to go back. When you do it keeps the amount, date and check number. However you have to reselect the Club and License.</li>\r\n<li>Also one of the requests from account last time was that once a payment had been taken by the system for the screen to reopen on the Add payment screen so they can continue to enter payments.&nbsp; Now it reopens the payment you just entered and was a good step to check it, but now that the system it checking they can move on faster.</li>\r\n<li>Under the Manager New Lease Bids in blue &ldquo;view lease&rdquo; this opens a log in page and not the lease?</li>\r\n<li>We have talked about consistency and we do like the forest being listed beside the club in search screens so that we do not have to open multiple clubs to find the right one.&nbsp; The following are screens that still need this: Manage Payment, Print Labels, Generate Amendments, Billing Report, Income Report</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Questions, Answers, and Concerns as of Session 501</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The answer to item 4 is because updates are made to the HLA records as part of the amending blocks. Therefore, you must amend a block from an HLA record (the lowest point in the database structure being effected by the change).</li>\r\n<li>For item 6, there is no year selection. The acres by state is for the whole database. I a year selector needs to be added or it needs to calculate only for the current year, I can do that. However, this is not a bug fix.</li>\r\n<li>I didn\'t fully understand item 7. With few exceptions, I fundamentally cannot answer questions regarding what Hancock wants. As far as I can tell, the penalty is behaving as Sarah and I agreed it should as per our e-mail conversation last May. If this is no longer how we wish it to function, we will need to rework that system, which is not a bug fix.</li>\r\n<li>In item 9, I do not know what \"CSZ\" is and cannot find it. Point me to where I can find that on the website and I can investigate it. On the subject of penalties, Sarah and I discussed how the penalties should function in May, 2012. I explained that the HLA total due is calculated when the record is added or edited and that the penalty has never been used on the website before. We agreed that this field should be zeroed out for all HLAs and added to the total when it is filled in. The trade-off is that the statement on the public side of the website does not reflect the penalty charge automatically when the duedate has passed. This is by design because the total due doesn\'t recalculate on display. If HLAs need to apply a penalty to their total when their due date passes, we can write a cron that will do that every night as HLAs pass their due date. This, however, is not a bug fix.</li>\r\n<li>Item 11 was difficult to understand. What is meant by, \"HLA Blue\"? I tested the Add Amendment function and found no issues. If there was an anomaly amending a specific record, it would be helpful if I knew what record that was. If you selected a malformed record and cause the website to hiccup when processing it, the test would work just fine for me if I picked a test record that was not malformed. The more information I am provided, the better.</li>\r\n<li>I cannot do anything with item 12. A glance at the e-mail log indicates that e-mails are definitely going out from the website. If e-mails are not arriving in a specific inbox, it may be getting caught in a spam filter or the account in question has an incorrect e-mail address.</li>\r\n<li>With item 14, more clarity is needed. I barely understand the issue being expressed here. I have made an attempt to pre-populate the bid form to make it more friendly. I\'ll need further instruction to go further.</li>\r\n<li>Item 15 is structurally impossible. An available lease record does not have sufficient information to calculate a total due. The process of converting a successful bid to an HLA gathers the remaining information needed to do this.</li>\r\n<li>I am unable to replicate item 16.</li>\r\n<li>I will need more instruction on item 17. This is a matter of how we select the serial number on the new HLA. The issue being experienced here is that the serial that is chosen by default is not unique. That is a bug, but I am not entirely sure what method is most desirable in fixing it.</li>\r\n<li>I am unable to replicate item 18. The bids information appears to be saving and displaying in total for me.</li>\r\n<li>I need further instruction on item 22. The front and back office login systems are separated for security purposes. If you wish to browse up an available lease on the front site, you must be logged in on the front site. Otherwise, the links can be pointed to an alternative location in the back office.

Many of which are clearly indicated as fixed in the Excel file. Moreover, some of the listed issues include design or data issues that require decisions or action by Campbell personnel rather than Bandwise. I set my Excel to filter out issues that have been fixed per Campbell\'s satisfaction, so I will only address what has not.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Following are my initial reviews of the file:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Item 2a - I have received the Access database and have converted its data into MySQL. I can now begin utilizing it in addition to the Oracle data. However, this largely puts my long-established data import plan back at the drawing board without detailed instructions on what data I need to use from which source and where. The more I am required to analyze and guess on my own, the more likely I am to make errors and the longer this project will take.</p>\r\n<p>Item 2b - This issue is most likely related to Item 2a. I demonstrated for Barb that the Oracle data that I had been using to populate the club information was as spotty as the HCM back office reflects. Once I have integrated the Access data into the import process, the club information will, most likely, get corrected.</p>\r\n<p>Item 4 - This issue is <strong>very likely</strong> the result of Item 2a, missing Access data. See my review of Item 2b.</p>\r\n<p>Item 5 - This requires no action on my part. However, I want to stress that historic data from older systems are like ropes. The closer to get to the end, the more frayed the rope becomes. As such, the quality of the data degrades. This means more and more orphaned records and unnecesarily slowed server response time trying to sift through them. It is all about reasonable housekeeping. The key is to decide how far back you will ever need to go in the new system, accept the benefits as well as the trade-offs, and keep separate backups of the oldest data just in case you ever need it. Naturally, I have backups of all of the data I have been provided. A very rudimentary interface accessing the Oracle and Access data for historic data lookup is not impossible.</p>\r\n<p>Item 6 - I have the membership table in the Oracle data, but I have concerns about associating members with historic clubs. If the Access table is used for this, I may need instruction on how to do this.</p>\r\n<p>Item 7 - The membership list is one of tabs on the Club Dashboard. It is called \"Roster.\" As per Item 6, the roster is not fully populated yet, but this is where it will be.</p>\r\n<p>Item 8 - This requires no action on my part. I will standby for instruction if a decision is made that requires me to change anything.</p>\r\n<p>Item 10 - As per job #1278, \"I started looking for [lease 2235]. I was able to find it in the Oracle dump, but it doesn\'t appear in my database nor my error logs. After some examination, I discovered why. The LSEEXPIRESCCYYMMDD field in the Oracle dump is being used to filter the leases later than the 2007 cut off date requested by Morgan. When I query for this lease in the Oracle dump, an invalid date is returned in this field, causing it to be excluded from the import entirely.\" In short, this lease was excluded because it is a malformed record in the Oracle dump. If it gets fixed, it\'ll get imported. My latest imports have inserted many more leases into CT, so this may have resolved this issue.</p>\r\n<p>Item 11 - I agree with the observation. In the new system, an invoice doesn\'t get \"zeroed out.\" A credit memo is inserted to negate its balance. I have since made note of the 2222 convention in my import script. When one is encountered, a credit memo is inserted rather than an additional payment. However, this has left me with a different issue -- write-offs. Some clubs have written checks for round numbers, leaving an overpayment of a few dollars or less that Barb tells me simply get written off. I need to know how this is to be handled. How do I recognize these when I encounter them during import?</p>\r\n<p>Item 12 - I have fixed this.</p>\r\n<p>Item 13 - This requires no action on my part. I will standby for instruction if a decision is made that requires me to change anything.</p>\r\n<p>Item 16 - This has been fixed.</p>\r\n<p>Item 17 - This has been fixed. It was most likely a minor typo that has simply gone unnoticed.</p>\r\n<p>Item 18 - I need instruction on how to do this. As far as I know, the Exhibit A is a separate PDF. I can investigate how prudent it may be to insert the Exhibit A PDF into the appropriate page of the contract PDF, but I cannot yet make any indication if this is possible.</p>\r\n<p>Item 19 - If I understood this concern correctly, it is not true. Currently, the Exhibit A is a PDF associated with the lease when it is created in the back office. It can be downloaded, read, and attached to an e-mail.</p>\r\n<p>Item 20 - When invoices are inserted, a notification is e-mailed to the club contact instructing him/her to login to the website and view the invoice. Viewing the invoice online will allow them to see live updates as payments are received and the balance ticks down to zero.</p>\r\n<p>Item 21 - I will be asking Morgan about the wisdom of separating the signed and unsigned copy of the contract documents so that they cannot be overwritten.</p>\r\n<p>Item 22 - The Prorate Adjustment calculator was fixed on March 1 in job #1282.</p>\r\n<p>Item 23 - The Preview Invoice screen was added to the 7-step process on March 1.</p>\r\n<p>Item 25 - I can investigate these, but I need specific examples of which ones do not appears so I can trace back through the data and find where they failed to be included.</p>\r\n<p>Item 27 - This has been explained. In the HCM system, leases have a start date and end date that indicates when the lease begins accepting offers on the web and when it stops and disappears from the website. In other words, the user who created or last edited the lease can select when it \"falls off the web,\" giving maximum control to the land lease administrators in addition to some level of automation.</p>\r\n<p>Item 29 - The user profile page can be gutted to any degree within reason. There are a few small items that are necessary for the login system to function properly and a few items heavily used by the social networking system (i.e. first name, last name, avatar, etc.). Otherwise, anything can be cut and the system won\'t complain. Some of these optional items will be completely ignored by most users. Conversely, some of them may be useful for customer relations which is why they are in the system in the first place. As Allen has pointed out, 90% of all users will completely ignore the birthdate field on the profile. However, the few who do not can be sent a yearly birthday greeting from Campbell.</p>\r\n<p>Item 30 - This item has been fixed. Allen instructed me to remove the lease photo entirely from he system, so no thumbnail image is displayed now. I have also changed the listings to indicate that maps will be provided on each detail record.</p>\r\n<p>Item 33a &amp; 33b - This has been explained. The 8 wasn\'t dropped. The HCM system allows clubs to have identical names. The club name is used to generate a web address for the club members to access their club\'s social networking area. For example, when Danny created the Cross Cut Hunting Club, a web address of \"http://www.tcgrecreation.com/club/cross_cut_hunting_club\" was generated for that club\'s members. Now, here is the dilemma. Web addresses <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">must</span></em></strong> be unique! In the back office, an administrator attempting to create a club will be asked for the club name. The form will not complain if the club name is already taken. However, if the club name is taken, an additional field will automatically appear, asking for the administrator to make the web address name unique. In short, yes, the club name will never exactly match the exact name of the club because club names allow for duplications and characters that web addresses do not. If a customer calls in with a question about their club, the actual club name is what should be referenced while the club\'s web address should be referenced only if asked.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"/images/club-urlname-distinction.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"751\" height=\"566\" /></p>\r\n<p>Item 34 - There are no steps for leases on hold. Lease may be placed on hold or back into other status codes anytime. I have a small concern about whether or not this should be allowed. Leases should be terminated only under certain circumstances and should not be allowed to change after that. I would need to know more about the circumsances under which a lease would be placed on hold before I can render any similar concerns there.</p>\r\n<p>Item 35 - I have received no instruction on any scanner. If this is desired, I will need a detailed description of what it is and what it does.</p>\r\n<p>Item 36 - The footer at the bottom of the e-mail templates can be changed anytime and doing so takes only a moment. I just need to know what need to go there.</p>\r\n<p>Item 37 - I have no actions to take on this issue. I have entered and assigned forester as described in Morgan\'s Word file. If this needs changing any admin can do so in the Manage Tree Farm section of the back office or I can do it.</p>\r\n<p>Item 38 - This issue was fixed on March 15. It was related to database indexing and shouldn\'t happen again.</p>\r\n<p>Item 42 - I have been no instruction on \"distinctive\" site locations.\"</p>\r\n<p>Item 44 - Currently, when a lease is added, a section in Manage Leases allows an administrator to associate a document with a lease. This can be a PDF, DOC, KMZ, or any other kind of file. The admin can also select which type of document is it (i.e. Exhibit A, topo map, imagery map, etc.). As far as jpeg maps, I haven\'t been provided any. I have only beed given PDFs and KMZs.</p>\r\n<p>That concludes my initial assessment of the bug and issues list.</p>','',4,'http://www.tcgrecreation.com',0,5.62,0,0,4),(1303,2,2,0,1363755600,0,10,'March 21, 2013 Meeting','<p>Test the website, copy to clubtest, and attend the meeting.</p>','',6,'http://www.tcgrecreation.com',0,0.00,0,0,1),(1304,2,2,0,1363842000,0,10,'Bug Fixes - March 21, 2013 Meeting','<p>The following bugs were encountered during today\'s meeting.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The table background on the Admin Home page is, again, not working in IE.</li>\r\n<li>In Edit Leases, the search filters are not functioning.</li>\r\n<li>Add searching lease numbers by serial.</li>\r\n<li>In Step 5 of the Available Leases, the scanner button doesn\'t open in IE.</li>\r\n<li>Invoice Preview is not showing lease number or Landowner name within the Payment box.</li>\r\n<li>The Add Payment form is not populating.

I have been instructed to review it and report my findings. It is worth noting that last week\'s meeting did not include a review of last week\'s bug list, so there was no progress on updating Campbell on them despite progress being made in fixing them.</p>\r\n<p>After having a look, issues 1 through 44 were in the March 20 Bug List. In this job, I will address new issues that have not been completed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>\r\n<p>Item 45 - I can generate any desired reports. I only need to be shown a sample of what it should look like with a brief explanation of how to get the figures therein.</p>\r\n<p>Item 46 - See Item 45 above. I can do this easily enough, but it\'ll be a really thin report. Do Campbell personnel only need a list of clubs? What else should appear on this report alongside the clubs?</p>\r\n<p>Item 47 - See Item 45 above.</p>\r\n<p>Item 48 - System generated journal entries (aka club history records) are done throughout the system. Adding an invoice or payment will generate some, even if the club contact pays online from their club web interface. Most of the accounting functions generate many such entries. Step 3 of Batch Renewals generates more than many. E-mailing a club contact from the dashboard will also generate one. Entries may be added manually from a club\'s dashboard. It is difficult for me to instruct Campbell personnel on how to test these because this is a Campbell convention with which I am personally unfamiliar. In short, this is a situation of \"it\'s your voodoo, not my voodoo.\" I\'m not entirely sure if I have the correct entries in the all of the necessary places. I recommend Campbell personnel testing website features that they believe \"should\" generate an entry and simply monitor the club\'s history on the dashboard before and after. If the expected entry is not generated, notify me with detailed instructions and I will make it happen. As for the \"import file at month-end,\" I have no idea what that is.</p>\r\n<p>Item 49 - I am not sure what to do about this. I can turn test mode off in seconds, but then we must be extremely cautious in testing. E-mails <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>will</strong></em></span> begin going out and the database is full of live data. If we turn off test mode, we will be restricted to testing only on test data that we insert specifically for that purpose. The trade-offs are that 1.) we no longer have the certainty of being able to test any random records and; 2.) we can no longer test Batch Renewals or any of the clubs imported from the Oracle dump.</p>\r\n<p>Item 50 - Danny and I discussed this, but I still do not recognize the merit of adding this. Step 2 of the 7-step process e-mails the applicable foresters a report on a given lease, detailing everyone who has made an offer on it. The forester\'s report includes an approval button, so that he or she may approve a favored bidder. Alternatively, the foresters may ignore their reports entirely, leaving a lease administrator to approve one of the offers. If the forester recognizes one or more bidders as being highly unfavorable, the forester may e-mail a reply back and explain the disapproval. Any offers that were not approved during the 7 steps will be sent a rejections e-mail at step 7. From a database perspective, what needs to happen to an unfavorable offer at Step 2? Does it need to be deleted or otherwise rendered unselectable for approval? If nothing, what is this \"disapprove\" button suppose to do in to the database records?</p>\r\n<p>Item 51 - Danny and I discussed this. Currently, every land owner account has an \"account name\" which I using to populate that variable in the invoice template. If this is incorrect, I have two options: 1.) Use a different field in the land owner table; 2.) Add a new field to the land owner table just for this purpose. I can do whichever Campbell wants done.</p>\r\n<p>Item 52 - This will be done immediately. I was only informed about this late last week. Removing this will be a very quick and easy process.</p>\r\n<p>Item 53 - I am not sure what to do about this. Step 1 of Batch Renewals is only available if the selected tree farm has contracts expiring this year. If Campbell currently has no tree farm in this process, then I would need to generate fake test data, which is what I forced to do when I initially wrote this process.</p>\r\n<p>Item 54 - This issue doesn\'t require any action from me at this time. I have discussed this with Morgan and this page is as he instructed me to design it. Morgan stated that the spreadsheets received from the area managers are often full of errors that force manual review of the data anyway. Automating this process will permit Campbell personnel to skip reviewing the data for errors when they shouldn\'t be doing so. There doesn\'t appear to be a solution for the room for error at this time. Morgan and I have discussed adding \"smart buttons\" to make this process fast and smooth, but this is in the works for post launch. If Campbell has no contracts expiring this year, this shouldn\'t be an issue anytime soon.</p>\r\n<p>Item 55 - I am unable to determine the issue as described. Is there a problem with how this process is being done?</p>\r\n<p>Item 56 - This has been added to my \"to do\" list and should be done this week.</p>\r\n<p>Item 57 - I tested this once more and found it to be working perfectly. I suspect there was an anomaly related to the specific club with which we were working -- perhaps malformed data from the Oracle dump.

I can break down Excel files, which is fortunate for Campbell. Allen has instructed me to determine the most efficient data structure for doing this.</p>\r\n<p>I have some initial concerns:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Data structure is not the only barrier preventing efficient importing of data. Data conversion is a much more prominent issue. For example, Campbell is unlikely to provide Excel files with user IDs in them. They will, instead, provide me with names of people who may or may not have user accounts. These values will contain typos, extra spaces, various ways of spelling the name, variation in letter cases, and all manner of errors that will cause any script I write to fail in keeping track of them. I almost necessarily need user IDs to avoid this, but this places more labor on Campbell in preparing their data and it is often unclear where these substitutions need to be.</li>\r\n<li>I need to know what all information will be provided to even begin formulating a plan for how to do it. Am I importing leases only or am I importing everything from the tree farm record down to the club contacts and members? One of these is an extremely simple task while the other is likely impossible via this method.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This script has been elusive for years because it is a classic catch-22. It is intended to minimize the amount of labor that goes into entering data, but requires a significant amount of labor to prepare the data in such a way that it works. I believe the key is to provide data analysis tools intended to minimize the data preparation and let the import script work with IDs everywhere possible.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if a user account is referenced in a row of data, it needs to be replaced with a user ID, implying that the user account needs to exist beforehand! I can then provide Campbell personnel with back office tools for acquiring and exporting user IDs to be used in their Excel data which is then used for importing.</p>','',2,'http://www.tcgrecreation.com',0,36.96,0,0,8),(1376,31,2,0,1374210000,0,10,'Lessor Report','<p>Morgan requested a minor Excel report.

The CMS needs an upgrade to a more flexible MySQL library.</p>\r\n<p>The developers of PHP have <a href=\"http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-query.php\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> in recent years their intention to retire the original MySQL API. At some point in the future, a PHP upgrade will include a version of PHP that no longer contains this API. This will instantly cripple the entire website. Fixing this would take weeks.</p>\r\n<p>I do not anticipate this being an issue this year, but I do not like this type of surprise. I have already prepared a database communication library of my own design that dynamically inspects the server environment and uses whatever MySQL API is available, prioritizing the one with which I am most familiar and excited to adopt: MySQLi.</p>\r\n<p><strong>EFFICIENCY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Updating the database engine will increase the server efficiency. I will be adapting each script to utilize the fetch array capabilities of the MySQL APIs rather than building arrays for each field selected -- a sort of lazy approach we have always used. Using the MySQL fetch approach is a bit less intuitive, but results in faster website loads and less memory usage, which is why I use it ad nauseum in my Ajax pages and crons. It is only ubiquitous in the CMS platform.</p>\r\n<p><strong>DATA INTEGRITY</strong></p>\r\n<p>The new MySQL APIs have plenty of impressive features that I excited to use. One that I have wanted for a long time is the transaction buffer.</p>\r\n<p>Numerous database operations on the website involve multiple database inserts and updates in sequences. If any of them fail for any reason, changes made up to that point cannot be easily undone. For example, an invoice can be inserted, but the query to note it in the club history or ledger may fail for some reason. I can delete the invoice and throw an error -- essentially a rollback. Unfortunately, when the operation in question is more than six queries, it becomes a far more tedious and error-prone chore to error check each one and adapt the whole operation to rollback on error.</p>\r\n<p>The transaction buffer allows me to give MySQL a pre-emptive warning as to what queries I will be executing before actually doing so. If any errors are present in them, MySQL can alert me before I\'ve made any database changes at all. There is no need for any rollback. If no errors are returned, I can commit all queries in a single stroke.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>\r\n<p>There will also be a security enhancement to come out of this upgrade. Currently, I use very meticulous string escaping practices on every form input to avoid the potential for SQL injection attacks. However -- and thank goodness (!!!) -- this is no longer an industry standard approach to security. <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.prepared-statements.php\" target=\"_blank\">SQL prepared statements</a> are now the most secure means of preventing SQL injection and ensuring SQL inputs are properly understood. Not only does injection become impossible, but SQL syntax errors as a result of user input of SQL reserved characters (like apostrophes) as well. I can\'t wait to get this into the system!</p>\r\n<p><strong>UPGRADE PROCEDURE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Upgrading the database library will not be fast. It is what I like to call a \"run-around\" fix. I will need to change nearly every PHP page throughout the system. If it is not done, the server hosts in the datacenter will at some point in the future upgrade the server software which will cause the website to return \"Parse error: mysql_connect function not found,\" disabling the website entirely until this problem is fixed.</p>','',2,'http://www.cglease.com',0,14.11,0,0,3),(1548,31,2,0,1405400400,0,2,'PERPETUAL: Updates and Cleanup','<p><strong>This is a perpetual task. </strong>As we refine the system over time, old approaches to system-wide structure are replaced by new approaches that are more consistent, easier to troubleshoot and service, and take advantage of news technologies available.</p>\r\n<p>This is a standing task is intended to account for time used for general updates and cleanups intended not to change website behavior, but to make the code cleaner and easier to service when needed.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Consolidate and recycle files and functions</li>\r\n<li>Remove temporary files</li>\r\n<li>Refine logging and testing functions</li>\r\n<li>Install new smarty templates</li>\r\n<li>Update old libraries, modules, and core functionality to be consistent with the new libraries (i.e. Ajax, popCalendar, dialogues, mail, etc.)</li>\r\n</ol>','',2,'http://www.cglease.com',0,45.88,0,0,10),(1549,31,2,0,1405573200,0,10,'July 7, 2014 Meeting','<p>Morgan came by to discuss a few small fixes and update my tasks.</p>','',6,'http://www.cglease.com',0,0.00,0,0,1),(1550,31,2,0,1406091600,0,10,'July 23, 2014 Meeting','<p>Morgan has arrived for a meeting.</p>','',6,'http://www.cglease.com',0,0.00,0,0,1),(1551,31,2,0,1406523600,0,10,'Unsigned Contracts','<p>During this week\'s meeting, Morgan stressed the need to press club contacts for contracts that have not yet been signed.

Morgan wants each step to require a single human intervention as oppose to compressing some events into single steps. Also, Morgan wants contracts requiring his electronic signature to be visible and easily identified.</p>\r\n<p>On Step 5, an interface is presented to scan in the contract, exactly as the form is right now. When a contract is scanned in, it jumps to Step 7. Alternatively, a customer may apply an electronic signature on their contract sitting at Step 5, pushing the lease to Step 6. Step 6 leases are for Morgan only and require his electronic signature. After signing, these leases jump to Step 7. On Step 7, the invoice is issued. On Step 8, the payment is made either by scanning in a check or making an electronic payment. Step 9 becomes the new completed step.</p>\r\n<p>To start this change, Step 5 needs no additional code. It only needs a slight change in its background process. After scanning in the contract, the lease jumps to Step 7 and the invoice form will be moved there. Step 6 needs a new interface displaying contracts awaiting Campbell endorsement. The Add Payment form will be moved from Step 6 to Step 8.</p>\r\n<p><strong>March 19, 2015 Update</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The second confirmation in the front office lease offer management needs a new question added. \"Have you viewed this tract?\" <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Done</span></li>\r\n<li>On step 2, deleting an offer doesn\'t work.

The job type field will be important here as it will be used in this calculation. I have added integer fields for job complexity, research time, and testing time. The complexity field will require human approximation, which will multiplied by the average the selected job type typically requires, divided by half. For example, if development tasks take 13 hours on average, a task estimated to be of level 4 complexity would take an estimated 26 work hours (or just over 3 work days).</p>\r\n<p>Research and testing hours will be added directly to the estimated time.</p>\r\n<p>UPDATE: I had an intriguing idea on how to make the time estimation mechanic more accurate over time. Part of the formula needs to look at closed jobs of the same type and calculate the average time in which they were over or under their estimation and add that to the estimation being calculated.

I e-mailed her to ask why she did this and she replied.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>That\'s a good questions.&nbsp; I guess when I went in this morning and opened CX-3075-1 I still could not see the contract, so when I generated another one I must have linked the CX-3075-0 to the contract I created.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>This is not how historic records are maintained in the system. I will need to manually put the records back so historic data will show up where it is suppose to be.

For the purpose of the website application, Bandwise has its own access  to Campbell\'s CyberSource accounts, so we use our own username and  password. See Bandwise\'s 1Password database for these login credentials  and keep them up to date if any passwords change and do not forget to update Campbell\'s land owners as well.</p>\r\n<p>Note: CyberSource occasionally demands that accounts change passwords. Failure to do so may result in the above error as well. When logging in to a CyberSource account, change the passwords on all of them if prompted to do so and do not forget to update the land owner account credentials when doing so.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Configuring CyberSource</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Campbell website has multiple CyberSource accounts -- one for each land owner. If you browse up Manage Land Owner Accounts in the Campbell back office, there is a Gateway Credentials field to enter login credentials for CyberSource. This input takes a JSON string of login credentials formatted as:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;\">{\"merchant_id\":\"<span style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">[merchant_id]</span>\",</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;\">\"username\":\"<span style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">[username]</span>\",</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;\">\"password\":\"<span style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">[password]</span>\",</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: small;\">\"transaction_key\":\"<span style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">[transaction_key]</span>\"}</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>For executing sales transactions, only the merchant_id and transaction_key are used. However, the query transaction API uses the merchant_id, username, and password. The merchant_id is provided by Campbell Global and will never change. When a new account is setup, Bandwise must be provided with a setup e-mail so that we can determine our own username and password. Add these to 1Password! The transaction_key is setup in the CyberSource business center. Be aware that CyberSource has a test environment and a production environment so pay attention to which one is being setup. As of Nov, 2016, the path to the transaction_key setup is: Account Management -&gt; Transaction Security Keys -&gt; Security Keys for the SOAP Toolkit API. Paste the appropriate information into the JSON string above and paste the entire JSON into the Gateway Credentials field in the Campbell back office. The website should be ready.</p>','',8,'http://www.cglease.com',0,0.00,0,0,0),(1935,31,2,2,1479156193,0,10,'Nov 14, 2016 Meeting','<p>Morgan has arrived with more tasks to add.</p>','',6,'http://www.cgleasedevelopment.com',0,0.00,0,0,0),(1936,31,2,2,1479156261,0,10,'HCM Stats Report','<p>Morgan says the report of almost ready.

Allen wants to be able to control how Google is queried by the scraper <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">in that he wants to feed it a selected industry or store type, a city, an optional state or state abbreviation, and a pre-determined pattern in which to arrange these values. At first, he suggested an interface similar to the defense application\'s rule manager, but I suggested just having a table of template strings instead of separate files as the rule manager is. In either case, it means I need to be able to parse a simple template string. I have two options for that: Smarty and PHP eval function.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Smarty is a template engine already widely used throughout our applications and is intended for this purpose -- parsing template strings. Using a template engine for simple one-liners is a bit overkill, but Smarty is more secure than eval. The PHP eval function is quicker and easier, but is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>highly unadvisable</strong></em></span> for security purposes. After much discussion yesterday and a follow-up discussion with Kevin today, we\'ve reached a consensus that Smarty will be used. I will start on the interface for managing this table.</span></p>\r\n<p>Allen has changed his instructions. He now wants a file import that accepts a CSV file that populates the search terms table and this table alone will be queried by the scraper.

First, the only option we have for locating the address to a brands page is to look for all hyperlinks on the page with the text \"brands\" in it. This is messy would only work half the time. Assuming it did work, we would have the source code and now need a means of counting the brands on it. Allen suggested targeting a famous brand name to give the scraper a means of \"getting its bearings.\" In programming terms, that is a meaningless instruction. Scrapers are written assuming a consistent page structure. If we don\'t know the structure of the page, there are no bearings to get. If a scraper can be written to adapt to the structure of its DOM, I certainly don\'t know how to do it nor have I ever heard of that even being a thing.</p>','',2,'http://furnisys.bandwise.com',4,0.00,0,0,0),(2111,125,3,3,1499958817,0,5,'Update Consumer Confidence Report 2016','<p>Update Consumer Confidence Report 2016, &nbsp; File is a Google Docs Document, adding some additional Excel informtion to report, regenerate PDF document, and update links in the Documents section of back office.&nbsp;</p>','',10,'www.villagewatersysinc.org',4,3.10,0,0,4),(2112,132,2,2,1499975324,0,-10,'Clearbit Trial and API.ai','<p>Allen has requested that I sign Bandwise up on Clearbit\'s API trial and put together a quick API script that will query its database.

This keeps errors and notifications separate, but you also lose the chronology of events and there is no log to tail until the script finishes.

The contract record includes a \"leasetermmos\" column that is intended to count the number of months for which the contract is valid (necessary for detecting when a contract needs renewnal). This value is hard-coded to 36 because Campbell Group only had 3-year contracts. There were outliers which had to be manually inserted, but few in number. Now, FRC routinely has term length variation across tree farms. The application largely bases term length on the number of acre rates added to the contract. For example, if a contract has been given 3 acre rates, it is calculated to be a 3-year contract billed every 12 month from its begin date. This makes the leasetermmos column mostly deprecated, but it is still being used in a few trivial places -- harmless if the contract has a 3-year term, but potentially harmful in cases where it does not. This is a recipe for deprecation error.</p>\r\n<p>Because Don\'s instructions have made it clear that term length variation is more than expected, now is the time to fix this deprecation. Ideally, I\'d want the entire app calculating the term length on display (especially Batch Renewals) as it is already doing in many places.

A tedious adjustment was necessary. I have had to update queries all around the back office to accommodate invoices. I believe this is finished, but testing may reveal query errors.\r\n\r\nTo help me in tracking additional errors, I have adjusted the MySQL error reporting in this copy of Majicko. The SQL errors will e-mail a report as normal, but include more information about what happened and where to locate the problem. Back office MySQL errors are now silent. Bad queries will simply return no rows, but will still alert us via e-mail when a problem occurs.\r\n\r\nOn the club dashboard, I have continued building the lease view. As you land on the lease view page of the dashboard, a pair of select menus will prompt the user for the lease and contract they wish to view. Upon selection, the lease view will appear on-screen and be populated (read-only) with the lease and contract information. This is consistent with the old LLS system.

The lease and contract summaries are almost complete.\r\n\r\nI uncovered a small road bump. I must build in the table and management features for adding additional charges and adjustments to an club\'s balance. This will be needed for display in the Billing Details segment of the lease view. A table already exists for charges, but I was not aware of what in the database to which charges needed to be associated. For example, clubs will receive their invoices in July and pay them by August. If the club damages the property in December, how would a forester input a charge in the back office to bill the club for the damage? Scenario #1: Accounting practices dictate that the existing invoice cannot be edited, so Campbell would create a new invoice and include this charge? This creates a problem discussed below. Scenario #2: The charges are associated with the contract id (the same way camping fees are) and are included in the next invoice. Conversation with a Campbell accountant may be necessary to work out how this is done.\r\n\r\nCampbell\'s Genus system somehow calculates when a given contract will bill again in the future. I\'m not certain how to do this, especially if we can expect additional invoices on an account to be cut throughout the year.\r\n\r\nI have added the CSS styling and TPL structure for the billing details and compartments segment of the lease view.

Pulled off to respond to e-mail by David Green (Hancock).'),(9,1015,2,1331310876,1331319311,'I investigated the three issues.\r\n\r\nIssue #1:\r\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,710 rows of information belonging to blocks and their corresponding HLAs and clubs, if applicable. My import script can only insert a club if the club information was provided. The script will only insert an HLA if it has the club\'s information to which to assign it. At a brief scan, I was able to locate 95 rows in the Excel file that had no club information. Thus, the script inserted a block with the relevant information provided, but no HLA or club. This is consistent with how the back office validates manually inserting a new HLA. If you do not select a club when you insert a new HLA, the validation will stop you. In summary, there are 1,710 new blocks and 95 of them had no club, thus no HLA. It would take more time to account for the last 3 missing HLAs, but I suspect these HLAs may have been deleted from the back office. With no admin activity logging on the website, I couldn\'t verify this.\r\n\r\nIssue #2:\r\nThe import script did use the provided contract numbers. See 11 Point Hunting Club. The provided contract number in the Excel file was GA-CG-0043-M-2011. The contract number visible in the back office is GA-CG-0043-M-1969. The 1969 on the end of the contract number is the HLA\'s effective year, which didn\'t make it over. See Issue #3 and Additional note below.\r\n\r\nIssue #3:\r\nThat is correct. When I converted the Excel file into XML for importing, Excel screwed up all of the dates, causing my script to fail converting them to Unix time for storage. This resulted in all timestamps getting set to zero (Dec 31, 1969). This is why 1969 appears on all of the contract numbers (see Issue #2).\r\n\r\nAdditional note:\r\nThere is a common misconception that I would like to address. If you examine the Add HLA form, you will note that it never asks for a &quot;contract number.&quot; The contract number we see on-screen in the back office is not stored in the database as you see it. It\'s a compilation of several pieces of information.\r\n\r\nLet\'s use this contract number for example:\r\nGA-CG-0043-M-2011\r\n\r\nGA = The state in which the block is located (see Block Number field).\r\nCG = The landowner of the block (see Block Number field).\r\n0043 = The serial number for this HLA  (see Serial Number field).\r\nM = A is for Amendment. M is for everything else (see Lease Type field).\r\n2011 = The 4-digit year of the HLA\'s effective date (see Effective Date field).\r\n\r\nIn the database, the contract number would look like this: &quot;GA-CG-0043&quot;, referred to as the &quot;license number.&quot; Whenever a page in the back office shows you a complete contract number, it queries for the license number, lease type, and effective date. It strings these bits of information together and shows you a complete contract number. The reason why it is done this way is because all &quot;master&quot; HLAs and their proceeding amendments will share the exact same license number (and are thus associated) with each other. In addition, if you must edit the effective year of an HLA, its contract number will update automatically.'),(10,1011,2,1331319360,1331331000,'Continued working on the lease view.

Since bullet item #8 depends on functionality which changes in bullet #1, I wanted to do #8 first and then #1. The problem is that I am starting to question how the database is structured as this project continues. I am finding myself having to hack solutions into place so that they appear to work. I am unhappy with the structure of the hcm_contracts and hcm_invoices tables. These are making data management frustrating.\r\n\r\nTotals billed to the customer are not fully calculated until an invoice is cut (after a contract is cut and signed), yet the hcm_contracts table contains a total due column that is either not used or shouldn\'t be because it reflects only the first year\'s calculations BEFORE all charges have been entered. Some of the figures calculated into the invoice total get queried from the contract as well as the lease depending on the type of invoice is being cut. Right now, all invoices added assume camping fees and acre fees are always being charged, but I have since been told that this is not the case. Not all invoices contain these charges and some invoices are, in fact, credit memos -- bearing a credit rather than charges. This means the acre and camping fees should never have been hard-coded this way. They should be in the charges table with everything else, applying only to the invoice on which they are entered.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the number of campsites and number of structures should be part of the contract record. Morgan has requested that the acre rate be moved to a separate table because it changes from year to year as a contract matures and the contract document will query and reflect 3 separate acre rates rather than one. The camping fees, prorate adjustment, and penalties should be part of the charges table. I can give Morgan a fancy calculator interface for them if he wants, but they should be treated based on what they are -- additional charges on the invoice which belong in the charges table. Total due should only reside in the invoice table as per the current state of the contract and charges entered on the invoice.\r\n\r\nI am going to start by updating the Add/Edit Invoice form and adding the widget for attaching charges to the invoice. This means I\'ll be altering the structure of the charges table to reflect attachment to invoices rather than contracts. I\'ll be adding some additional features to the Add Charges widget on the invoice forms so that any type of charge, penalty, fees, and adjustments can be made as per Morgan\'s requests. I will need to adjust a few things throughout the back office to reflect these changes, but I hope this will get us all back on track.\r\n\r\nConcerns:\r\n\r\nFor all of the blind-tasking, miscommunications, and changes in project direction going on, I am severely at a loss about where I am suppose to progress this project.

The user can fill in a 100-character description of the charge and its amount. I added a tab for the prorate adjustment function that Morgan asked for, but I need more information about how this is calculated since I am not working from a completed invoice here.

It is abundantly clear that the temporary table which holds the invoice totals and calculations is the culprit. Pages are fast and efficient on all scripts not using the function that loads this table. I checked indexing and tried to make this function as efficient as possible, but it appears to be maxed out.\r\n\r\nI have added some additional options to the function that loads the temp table. When possible, it loads only the records for a given group or date range. This speeds up most back office features, but a handful of locations in the back office cannot be improved this way. The more I think about this approach, the less I like it.\r\n\r\nI posted a question on Stack Overflow and the suggestion was that the process that collects and stores these figures should be executed by event or cron, rather than page hit. Executing by cron would cause a delay in the visibility of immediate changes to payments and invoice balances. In other words, adding a payment to the system would not be reflected in the reports until after the cron executes and recalculates the temp table. This would not be acceptable. Executing the totals by event would be ok, but it eliminates the point of this entire approach. We might as well store the values in the hcm_invoices table and update them by event. I was hoping to avoid this because accounting for all of the events throughout the system where this would need to be done is cumbersome and prone to error. It may be unavoidable.\r\n\r\nA compromise that would be quick to execute is this. I could convert the temp_invoicetotals into a permanent table and update this table by event. I would not need to change any of the joins. I would only need to change what the load process does and add some functions where payments are added to recalculate the balance. This is considered less efficient and less organized than the following method.\r\n\r\nI am seriously considering the more standard solution of re-adding the columns to the invoices table for storing these figures and simply recalculating them per event where payments are added. I would need to alter the code in roughly 50 places, but it would probably be the most standard and appropriate approach now.\r\n\r\nI am going to give this issue some thought before going further.'),(425,1216,2,1354653428,1354661631,'I attempted to start on job #1214 when I realized that this job would require joining into the invoices table.

I adjusted this function and the invoice now totals properly.\r\n\r\nI attempted to insert an invoice for the Big Chief Hunting Club to observe the insurance amount being inserted. The contract for Big Chief had no insurance amount filled in, so it would amount to zero. This may have been why no insurance amount was added when we last tested this. I amended the insurance amount and tried again. All appears to be working. This completes Item II.\r\n\r\nI changed the title on both front office and back office invoice templates. I checked the due date which appears to be printing just fine. We appear to have selected a malformed record during our last demonstration. We should pay attention to the invoice detail pages when picking a demonstration record. Putting the dollar sign on the acre rate is as easy as putting the dollar sign in the Javascript that populates the renewal charges function on the Add Invoice form. This has been done. It won\'t effect invoices in the system now, but will effect all invoices in the future. The batch renewal form will also do this. The LLS import scripts do not need to do this because they import the charge description directly from the old record. This completes item III.\r\n\r\nItem IV was a bit tricky. This query was attempting to match the contract based on a contract id saved in the lease bid record. This is ok for contracts inserted from a lease bid, but the lease now function doesn\'t generate a lease bid. I needed a different approach here. No user should ever be able to get to Step 5 without having a contract record attached to the lease and there should never be more than one contract attached to a lease being sold through either the 7-step process or the lease now function. I adjusted the query to match its contract by which ever contract is attached to the lease -- the direct approach. This should, in theory, work for both functions.\r\n\r\nI have added a button to Edit Contracts that will generate a new contract document from the contents of the database. This will allow me to do more testing on how the contract is compiled. I am unable to complete item V without more information from Morgan about where all of the variables in the contract are.\r\n\r\nI am running out of time and must pause here to get the test site ready for tomorrow\'s meeting.'),(477,1179,2,1357845488,1357848101,'The club test site is up to date and ready for demo.

Both appear to be working as normal.\r\n\r\nI have discovered some unacceptable data in the database. The old LLS permitted lease records to be contracted our to multiple clubs throughout its life. As such, an available lease from the old system may have prior contracts attached. The new web-based system keeps track of accounting and historic data, which means it does not permit leases to be contracted to more than one club. Many of the available leases in the database have prior contracts, rendering them glitchy in the new system. To resolve this for the demo tomorrow, I have disassociated these existing contracts from their leases, converting the available leases into truly available leases. To resolve this for launch, I will be adjusting the import scripts to set leases to either active or terminated based on whether or not they have prior contracts.'),(479,1245,2,1357855482,1357859151,'I experienced some connection issues.

This is a more preferable method, but the nth-child selector is not supported in IE8. It is supported in IE9 and up as well as all recent versions of Firefox and Safari. Company policy dictates that applications should be written for the two most recent versions of IE, Firefox, and Safari. Campbell, however, uses IE8 on all of their computers in order to maintain compatibility with other software they use. I have installed Selectivizr, a Javascript library that enables many CSS3 functionality in IE8. This has cleared up the issue. Campbell should be encouraged to explore other options besides using software that is compatible with only IE8. They are strategically painted into a corner by using products that holds their entire IT structure down to old software.\r\n\r\nhe Javascript issue we experienced was related to the use of a reserved keyword that jQuery required.

I am requested to print a total amount due on the bid result page to instruct the user on how much to pay following a lease now option.

Your best option is to try and educate your provider or switch to one who is not listed in APEWS as spam friendly. APEWS aims to avoid listing any non-spammer or non-spam support areas if possible - we just want to stop spam.\r\n\r\nMoreover...\r\n\r\nQ41: How does one contact APEWS? \r\nA41: One does not. APEWS does not accept removal request by email, fax, voicemail or letters. Bugging the APEWS maintainers is considered as additional abuse and will lead to escalations.\r\n\r\nAnd...\r\n\r\nQ42: My IP address/range is being listed by APEWS but I\'m not a spammer and I just signed up for this/these address(s). What can I do to be removed from the list? \r\nA42: APEWS is just an automated system, if spam or spam involvement (hosting spammers, selling spamware) from your IP address/range ceases, it will drop out of the list in time. Normally the listing involves spam related problems with your host and the first step you need to take is to complain to them about the listing, in almost all cases, they are the only people who can get an address/range out of the APEWS list.\r\n\r\nBased on the age of the APEWS listing, I am concluding that yesterday\'s campaign has nothing to do with being listed here and that there is no means of being removed from APEWS aside from contacting the data center and having them deal with it.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDnsbl.info also has an on-site search, but neither tcgrecreation.com nor its IP address are found in its database.

The files appear to be entirely benign. There is no javascript or apparent malicious code. These files bear markings of a hacker group known as the Indonesian Cyber Army. This group has a Facebook page and a Blogspot page. They claim to executes hacks in order to alert websites of security issues.\r\n\r\nOur first action was to determine how the files got into place. All of these websites are Majicko websites. I examined the back office logs in Majicko for some of these sites and found no excessive failed login attempts and no admin log entries showing files uploaded. I have concluded that these files got into place via a 3rd party component or server hole. As with previous experiences like this, a security hole in a 3rd party component is most likely.\r\n\r\nKevin and I began browsing some of the websites looking for additional files that do not belong. Kevin located PHP files in some of the websites located in the /modules directory. This added weight to my initial suspicion because this directory houses nothing but 3rd party scripts. All of the compromised websites contain a 3rd party script that involves uploading files -- Uploadify. Like many 3rd party scripts, the directory contained example scripts demonstrating how to handle a file upload. If a hacker can determine that Uploadify is in the web space, they can determine if this example file is still in place and use it to upload files.\r\n\r\nI put together a test form on my desktop that would submit a file to the Uploadify example page on Southern Knight Corvette Club. I had Kevin witness as I successfully uploaded a png file to the root directory of the website. I can find no other holes at this time.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThe offending file is: &quot;/modules/uploadify/uploadify.php&quot;. This file is completely unnecessary and should be deleted from all websites utilizing Uploadify. Majicko does not use this file as it has its own upload handler file that is tailored to Majicko and is more secure.\r\n\r\nKevin is executing server-wide searches of this file and removing them.\r\n\r\nIn the future, 3rd party modules need not contain example files.

This task is NOT a server update! It is an update to the website\'s core function libraries that has been sitting idle since Campbell\'s last major round of development requests. At the center of the HCM application is a content management system (CMS) and it contains three central core libraries that control basically everything: 1.) the DB library; 2.) the Majicko library; 3.) the Ajax library. The DB library is the highest of the three and controls all communications with the database, flexing to whatever server environmental HCM happens to be running on. The Majicko library contains all environmental data related to website settings, user session information, and tons of other items. The Ajax library merely a faster and more compressed version of the Majicko library that responds to different types of on-screen user events (i.e. clicking a button does something on-screen). As time goes by, old functions get changed (either by PHP updates or my own coding practices) and I sometimes must adjust older code to keep up with the current coding standards. This task is a rare and tedious adjustment to how the DB library binds values to a prepared query and how the query results are sent back. Query results (num_rows, insert_id, affected_rows) use to be returned in a base class property, but is now an object returned by the -&gt;execute() method. Moreover, it has come to my attention that the version of PHP we are running on the new server has no magic quotes functionality, so some of my functions intended to deal with this are now throwing background errors because PHP has since removed this function entirely. These are tiny fixes that take seconds, but are found in a lot of places. I recently gave Morgan a brief explanation of this to which he nodded and expressed that he is aware that updates like this need to be done as we\'re able to squeeze them in.'),(1940,1721,2,1461248191,1461262131,'I am going to pause this job for a moment to document what I\'ve got thus far. CyberSource is proving very frustrating to work with. Their documentation is bad. Their website contains explicitly inaccurate information about their APIs. Their APIs respond with useless information when they return errors. Their technical support personnel are so useless for this sort of problem that they are even willing to say so on the phone. The department that works directly on the APIs is one that is isolated from all customer contact, so getting direct integration assistance is completely impossible. The best option provided by their telephone support reps is to submit an eticket, which will be forwarded to the API department. In all cases, there is no direct response to and from customers and their API department. I currently have such a ticket waiting. Meanwhile, here is my current delay. CyberSource has many APIs and it has been a challenge simply selecting the correct one for the type of operation the website currently does. Both the CyberSource documentation and previous information by telephone have suggested I use the Secure Acceptance Silent Order POST API. My last few sessions working on this has been dedicated to engineering a working prototype which will submit a payment through this API and see it visible in the CyberSource business center. At that point, I will begin working on an API that can query the status of that payment, which will give me all of the functionality I need to start integration. No matter what I do, the API always rejects my submission. This morning, I tried directly using CyberSource\'s provided sample code to see if that results in the same error. It does, indeed, and showed me an additional problem. The Secure Acceptance API does NOT work as the documentation describes! It redirects customers to the CyberSource.com to enter the payment details, rather than staying on our website. This tangent has been a wild goose chase. I promptly called CyberSource again (the hold time NOT short, by the way). The representative on the phone confirmed that the Secure Acceptance API is a redirect and suggested (without commitment) that I try the SOAP API. He was not confident in this answer and told me to submit an eticket to ensure this is correct -- an exasperating admission, to be sure.\r\n\r\nWhile awaiting questions I posed in an eticket, I started over by examining the provided SOAP API sample code. This code left me puzzled. It does appear to do what we need, but I\'ve never seen a server side transaction done this way before. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a relatively new technology and requires installation of more PHP extensions. I had Corey install the SOAP library and I tested the sample code for this API. The good news: transactions are being submitted and are visible in the test business center. The bad news: they are all error transactions, return #150 which is a general &quot;unknown&quot; error. In other words, these test transaction failed and the API refuses to tell me why. I have questioned this in the eticket as well and are currently stuck until I get a response from someone at CyberSource who knows their job.\r\n\r\nI don\'t want my momentum on this job to stall, so I am going to work with what I know on the status API.

I\'ve come to the conclusion that doing so will involve much more coding than a simple patch would imply, such that this approach basically has no pros left, and would have to be done independently per version of Majicko. That being said, this solution would probably require the most coding and would be the most prone to error.\r\n\r\nSimply replacing offending files which replicate the outputs of old files will NOT work! The old MySQL functions were sloppily able to remember their most recent database connection -- even inside a function that should otherwise not have the DB connection in scope. This is both a benefit and a shortcoming as it made functions more resistant to scoping issues. However, none of the new MySQL libraries behave in this way. They demand the database connection be explicitly provided and its scope within functions maintained.\r\n\r\nWhat must be understood is how Majicko got to this point. Prior to Majicko 1.4, a new database connection was opened and closed for each individual query. This was a waste of server resources and caused page loads to be slower than necessary. Worse than that, this only works so long as the entire application has the database connection configurations in scope when it attempts to query the database and this led to scoping problems (which is why eval(__CONFIG__) was inside nearly all functions). An obvious solution was to do what every other coding practice does -- make a database connection at the top of the application, saving the connection resource to a variable for every query to use thereafter. This greatly increased efficiency and while it limited the scoping problems to only one variable, it still had those scoping problems. I had to intricately write every function throughout the application to keep scope of the $conn variable.\r\n\r\nWhen whispers of the MySQL functions in PHP being left out of future releases of PHP started, I abandoned this practice and followed the example of the Jelsoft developers. I made my own DB library that can smartly examine the server environment and use whatever MySQL library is available (using the deprecated functions only as a last resort). This DB library is defined as a parent class of the Majicko object (which is not in old versions of Majicko), so it can piggyback off of the scope of the Majicko object throughout the application -- solving deprecation, efficiency, and scoping issues all in one stroke. In order to &quot;patch&quot; an old version of Majicko, functions throughout the application would need to be rewritten. If we\'re going through all of that, we might as well crank out a patched version of Majicko compatible with PHP 7 and sell our customers an update.'),(2600,1963,2,1481214289,1481234576,'The meeting has concluded and new tasks have been entered.'),(2603,1969,2,1481234597,1481237876,'I spent time fixing some of the leases whose maps have been waiting.

The e-mail subject wasn\'t properly encoded, causing the template engine to throw an error rather than sending the campaign.

The function that generates the example contract has no record ID, so it can only mimic what the model does -- not use the model as the rest of the app does. Updates to the model over the past few months have not been happening to the example contract function (human oversight). The solution is to restructure the model slightly so that the method to build contract files is separated from the function that selects the contract record. This way, the function that issues the example contract may use the exact same model and, thus, never fall behind in updates.

Over all, the page is coming together.'),(4388,2507,2,1615389540,1615418880,'The social media and contact icons are drawn using a web font library called FontAwesome. The benefit of using this instead of images is that these are fully customizable using standard CSS. They behave like font characters, can be scaled, given style effects, and constrict themselves into your color scheme. The catch is that this web font library is embedded using a custom integration unique to Wordpress, but SCSS integration is also available. The 2nd catch is that I\'ve never done SCSS and Majicko doesn\'t currently have a SCSS compiler.

Luck was with me in that FontAwesome was also available in the Composer library, so everything was easier than I expected. I built a PHP file that engages SCSS/PHP and uses it to call on FontAwesome. It took some doing because I\'m simply not familiar with FontAwesome\'s archive of features, so I didn\'t initially know which ones I needed. The resulting stylesheet turned out to be HUGE and extended page loading time more than I\'d like. I built in what is functionally a cache so the stylesheet doesn\'t have to recompile on every page load.

The top menu was a giant headache. It neither looked good on narrow screens, nor did it behave obediently when opening and closing it. I did some redesign of how the menu is drawn. I added a hamburger bar that controls opening and closing of the menu on narrow displays. Amusingly, the guide I used to integrate the hamburger bar was using FontAwesome to draw the bar, so the new tools I installed are getting double use here. This menu includes a sub-menu for users who are logged in, so I had to style it to collapse into a single menu.

Second, I reviewed a failed payment by Gene Davis (lease CX-7006-3). He attempted to pay his invoice and cURL returned HTTP 0 when attempting to submit to the payment gateway. I have confirmed similar transactions since then have succeeded without issue. This was apparently a temporary outage.
